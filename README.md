Create a coding quiz that is timed and will store scores 
When clicking the start button, the first question pops up along with the timer starting at 60 seconds
When clicking an answer, it will go to the next question, and if choose wrongly then time is deducted 
when the timer reaches 0, or finished answering the questions, the game is over
once the game is over then the user wil save their initials & scores
